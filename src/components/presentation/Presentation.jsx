          And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Leela, are you alright?
          You got wanged on the head. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
          Moving along…

        <p>
          Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I love you,
          buddy! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you
          can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Dear God, they'll be killed on
          our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

          We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go
          home. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Are you crazy? I
          can't swallow that. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of
          cheesy New Year's costume?
